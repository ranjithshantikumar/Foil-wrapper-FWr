Foil wrapper machine touch panel got repaired   and it cost around  5lakhs although it controller cost is also more than a 3lakh was working but we are not able to use the function of the machine so as to temporary set up was done and machine was studied and whole setup was redesigned and circuit was programmed and built buy us now no need to buy a new spare including PLC and touch panel ,the cost incurred buy us is Rs 800 only now we are  using it for both of our foil wrapper machines so this is a great saving from us, we have also shared our circuit and program to Kochi  branch for them to use and modify it to their requirement. Mainly in this year starting government has asked us to stop using plastic so this machine was reprogrammed by us to be used with paper ,with the older original setup this may not be easily possible
